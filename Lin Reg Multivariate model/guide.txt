communication flow between technology and user in line with math:

- User import important libraries like numpy, pandas, etc
- User uploads / connects the data file with software/colab/tool/etc
- User creates the file as dataframe (df)
- User checks the first 3 heads to confirm the correctness of file.
- Note that here, user cannot plot graph on all x features combined due to 3D limitations.
-User calls liner regression from sklearn.linear_model library
- Or user can use seaborn lib and do reg(regression) during creation of plots. Its fun. Its given at the end of the codes.
- User FIT this model with existed data sets/points
- User check the prediction via one example or all datapoints.

File 'homeprices.csv' is source data
File 'Lin_Reg_Multivariate_codebasics.ipynb' is a colab code file for this linear regression multivariate model.
