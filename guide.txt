communication flow between technology and user in line with math:
1. User import important libraries like numpy, pandas, etc
2. User uploads / connects the data file with software/colab/tool/etc
3. User creates the file as dataframe (df)
4. User checks the first 3 heads to confirm the correctness of file.
5. User plots the existing data using matplotlib pyplot library
6. User calls liner regression from sklearn.linear_model library
7. User FIT this model with existed data sets/points
8. User provides new dataset to this model for prediction.
9. User check the prediction via one example or all datapoints.
10. User inserts these predicted points in new csv file
11. User finally plots the straight line with model.
